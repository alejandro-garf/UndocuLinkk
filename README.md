## **5. Technical Approach**

### **5.1 Research Component**

UndocuLink will maintain comprehensive databases to support undocumented and immigrant students in their job search and professional development. These databases will include:

- **Job Postings**: A regularly updated list of contractor job postings that match the skills and fields of study of undocumented students.
- **Fellowships and Scholarships**: Aggregated resources for funding opportunities from various organizations, helping students mitigate financial constraints.
- **Stipend-based Research Opportunities**: A list of research roles with stipends, allowing students to gain academic and professional experience.
- **Organizational Resources**:
  - **Nonprofits and Government Agencies**: A catalog of organizations offering support to undocumented and immigrant students.
  - **Private Sector**: Listings of private companies and foundations that provide resources for the immigrant and undocumented student community.

### **5.2 Software Development**

The UndocuLink platform will be built with a robust, scalable technical stack optimized for secure and efficient performance. Our design choices prioritize privacy, accessibility, and ease of use.

#### **5.2.1 Technology Stack (PERN Stack)**

- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management to store structured data securely, supporting complex queries, data integrity, and scalability.
- **Express.js**: A backend web application framework for Node.js that facilitates API development, middleware, and custom security configurations.
- **React.js**: For the frontend, providing a responsive, interactive user experience that is easily adaptable for future mobile integration.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment, powering the backend to handle high-volume network connections efficiently.

#### **5.2.2 Backend Development**

Our backend will be built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, chosen for their compatibility and performance capabilities. Key backend features include:

- **API Development**: RESTful API design will support CRUD operations, allowing for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
- **User Authentication**: Firebase Authentication will manage user accounts with minimal data storage, focusing on email-only identity management to enhance privacy.
- **Security**: Implementing secure authentication and encryption methods, focusing on user privacy and secure database interactions.
- **Data Structure and Storage**: PostgreSQL will be structured to accommodate large volumes of listings and partner organizations, using relational tables for job listings, scholarships, fellowships, and organizational data.

#### **5.2.3 Frontend Development**

The frontend will be developed with **React.js** to ensure a seamless, dynamic user experience. Primary aspects of the frontend will include:

- **Multilingual UI**: Accessible in multiple languages, ensuring inclusivity for students from diverse backgrounds.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring compatibility across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, meeting industry standards in UX.
- **User Privacy and Interface Design**: Limiting personal data entry while providing a robust interface that meets professional standards and student needs.

#### **5.2.4 Deployment and Hosting**

UndocuLink will be deployed using cloud infrastructure services for reliability and scalability, with a preference for:

- **AWS or Microsoft Azure**: Both platforms will be evaluated for cost-effectiveness, considering scalability, availability zones, and global content delivery networks.
- **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: Integrating automated testing and deployment to ensure seamless updates and efficient bug resolution.

#### **5.2.5 Version Control**

All development will be tracked via **GitHub**, allowing for real-time collaboration, version control, and issue tracking. GitHub’s pull requests and branching strategies will facilitate organized contributions and streamline code reviews.

## **6. Financial and Resource Requirements**

### **6.1 Infrastructure Costs**  
- **Hosting and Database**: Projected costs for cloud deployment (AWS or Azure) based on traffic projections and data volume.
- **Development Tools**: Licenses for software and tools, if needed (e.g., Firebase, version control, or project management tools).

### **6.2 Human Resource Requirements**  
The current team comprises experts in software, design, and project management. Additional support may be considered as the project scales or if specific expertise is required.

### **6.3 Marketing and Outreach**  
- **Collaborations**: Partner with California-based educational institutions and nonprofit organizations to expand the user base.
